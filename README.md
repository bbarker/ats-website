This is the source repository for the ats-lang.org website.

Or, hopefully it will be once it's ready. Right now there is a lot of
content that needs to be transfered over.

The intention here is to get the community involved in the maintenance
of our website and documentation. Patches welcome!

We're using [jekyll][1] to generate the html, and markdown to write the
actual pages.
